<h1>Setting Up Your Community</h1>
<p>If you are reading this page, chances are you have completed the installation! If this is true, congratulations on successfully installing OpenCAD! In this section, we will be outlining <strong><u>what to do after you install OpenCAD</u></strong>.</p>
<p>On the Dashboard, requests to join the community are approved or rejected. Only moderators or administrators can approve or reject users.</p>
<h2>User Management</h2>
<p>Depending on your configurations, users should be able to register for accounts. To access users, log into your OpenCAD application and enter the Admin Dashboard. Once logged in, click on <strong>User Management</strong> from the navigation menu on the left of your screen.</p>
<p>This dashboard shows you statistics at a glance across all teams. Below this, a table of all users in the application is found. This table allows you to moderate all users easily.</p>
<p>The <strong>Actions</strong> column provides links to click on for the user in that row.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Edit</strong> - Edit the current user's username, email, identifier, and user groups. (User groups are the departments they belong to.)</li>
  <li><strong>Change Password</strong> - Changes the current user's password.</li>
  <li><strong>Change Role</strong> - User / Moderator / Administrator. The administrator role is a <i>dangerous</i> role to give to users. Only give it to people you trust.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete</strong> - delete's the row and account.</li>
  <li><strong>Suspend without Reason</strong> - moderate the user without attaching a reason.</li>
  <li><strong>Suspend with Reason</strong> - moderate the user and use the textbox to append the reasoning.</li>
</ul>
