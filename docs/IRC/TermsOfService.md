# IRC Terms Of Service

By using the OpenCAD IRC Channels you indicate that you have read and agree to adhere to the [Libera Chat](https://libera.chat/policies) policies and procedures (as described on their website) and that you agree to the following:

== Channel Rules ==
 * In every OpenCAD IRC channel (this includes any channel starting with #opencad) the [[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct|Ubuntu Code of Conduct]] must be followed at all times by every user. This Code of Conduct is central to all aspects of OpenCAD and IRC is no exception.
 * You should check the topic and any entry message (send as a notice by Chan``Serv) when you enter a channel, they may give important information on specific channel rules and possibly channel logging.
 * In the [[IRC/IrcTeam/Scope|Core Channels]] the [[IRC/Guidelines|IRC Guidelines]] constitute the main channel rules, they must be followed by all users at all times.

== Logging ==
 * Some of the Ubuntu IRC channels are publicly logged on the internet, channels which are publicly logged will have "ubuntulog", and some may have other external logging bots.
 * When joining a channel which is publicly logged, either  Chan``Serv will send you a notice when you enter the channel informing you that it is logged, or it may be noted in the channel topic.
 * By participating in one of these channels you agree to have anything you send to the channel publicly stored or processed on http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/, or other external sites. (Note: these sites are also indexed by search engines, such as Google).
